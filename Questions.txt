- Maybe, check if are processes interatcing with the system, that are not registered as expected processes;
- Ask lab professor on how to do good testing.
- How is the comunication made between client and server? UDP?
- Do we need to add security between client - server?: just authentication with assymetric keys.
- What are "upcalls" in the context of the project?
- What kind of components do we need to test? All the link layer? Or just authentication?
- Should we use perfect links or even more complex abstractions as Reliable broadcast, etc: Just add digital signatures to every message and justify that we just want integrity and authentication on every message;
- What should be the result of the consensus protocol? The index of the appended message in the sequence of blocks (stored in the array)?
- Should we stop sending not achknowledge msgs after consensus is decided/over? If, for instance, PREPARE messages sent to processes that are not correct, are not acknowledged, they will be kept sending until the process received an ACK.
- What is the timeout for the leader change timer?

- Does the leader persist across rounds?
- Should we explain the flow of the IBFT protocol in the report? Should we explainn the normal case? Or just the view change Or none?

- If a node receives a PRE-PREPARE message from the leader, before calling startConsensus, what happens?

- Ask about this second stage points:
    - Strengthen the Byzantine fault tolerance guarantees of the system, including the ability to tolerate Byzantine clients.
    - Experimentally confirm the correctness, performance, and performance under attacks, of your implementation. In particular, a single malicious replica should not be able to slowdown the entire system.
    - the system should guarantee the non-repudiation of all operations issued on an account.

- What kind of byzantine client atacks can exist? For instance, when the client pretends to be the server and sends a message to another client (pretending to be the server replying to a request). Is that a byzantine client behavior?

- What should be recorded in the blockchain?
