- Check if to start consensus, all nodes/processes need to call startConsensus();
- The block number is probably represented by the consensus instance number. Maybe, if there are multiple clients making requests, the values should be buffered until they are decided;
- Store all keys (clients and servers) in just a folder, and then load them in Link layer;
- We should create two distinct links for server processes, because, when consensus service broadcasts a message, it sends it also to the clients;
- Check cuncurrency issues;
- Split ServerConfig into two classes: byzanthine and not byzantine processes;
- Maybe, we should have a class AuthenticatedLink that uses the Link class.
