- Check if to start consensus, all nodes/processes need to call startConsensus();
- The block number is probably represented by the consensus instance number. Maybe, if there are multiple clients making requests, the values should be buffered until they are decided.
- Store all keys (clients and servers) in just a folder, and then load them in Link layer.
